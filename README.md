# myflyn_app

A small Flutter project for Task Assignment by SuperCoder Recruitment Process. Implemented a mobile application based on the provided [Figma design].

## UI Libraries used

- Translations for figma - localization toolbox
    - for translating the Korean texts into English texts
- Figma to Code 
    - for getting the code snippets from the Figma Design. In order for me to maximize the given time, and also to ensure that I minimalize the chance of creating dev user error.
- Co-pilot on VS-Code 
    - Convenient for debugging (asking about coding problems) and get code completions
